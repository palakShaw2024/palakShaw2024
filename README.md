### Hey there! 

🚀 Data Science Learner | 💻 Full-Stack Developer | 🎨 Backend Enthusiast

💡 About Me

I’m passionate about learning how data and design can work together to create smarter, more interactive experiences.
Currently diving into the world of Data Science — exploring Python, SQL, Power BI, and the logic behind data-driven decision-making — while sharpening my web development skills.

I love bringing ideas to life, whether it’s a web app, a dashboard, or a creative experiment with data.
Curiosity keeps me building, breaking, and improving things every day.
